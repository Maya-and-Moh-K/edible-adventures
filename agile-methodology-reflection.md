## Prompt

As a group, answer the questions below. For each of these questions, consider specific examples to support your narrative.

- Reflect on your team's communication processes. How did Agile practices, such as **daily stand-up** meetings, facilitate communication and collaboration among team members?
- How did maintaining a **scrum board** play a role in the organization and delegation of tasks in your project?
- Reflect on your team's prioritization of tasks. How did your team create a **timeline for reaching MVP** and how did this prioritization assist in accomplishing your goals?
- What would you have done differently as a group to improve your communication, prioritization, or delegation of tasks?

## Reflection Response

1. We did a great job communicating via slack for the 2 days I wasn't present on campus. Maya was able to respond very quickly and used the scrum board to assign tasks and check off those completed. Along with that, I checked in with Maya every time there was a breakthrough or major update in our code, and she would do the same. We were able to have no issues with merging our branches or breaking our code.
2. Maya did a great job organizing and updating the scrum board. It was very easy for us to determine what work had to be done and we updated the scrum board accordingly. It saves time and energy because all our tasks are laid out for us.
3. I could have definitely communicated my work done the prior night, which had many bugs. Along with that, the priority should have been completing the MVPs first, then moving onto figuring out other parts of the project.
