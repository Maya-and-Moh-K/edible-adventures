# Edible Adventures

Created by Maya Ramishun and Mohammed Kanoongo.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, **Edible Adventures** is for **users who love making and eating new foods**. It allows users to **discover new recipes in any meal category**.

## API

This application will use the TheMealDB API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use.
<!-- Remember that you need one endpoint that gives you many things and from there get one thing -->
<!-- Which one of these is that? -->
- Link to API documentation: (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
- www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=
  - Name of the meal
- www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php
  - None, generates a random meal.
- www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=
  Takes a main ingredient and fetches results.

<!-- you do not need this -->
[If your API requires an API key, say so here.]
